How to build (client)
=====================

Make sure the git submodules are cloned (`git submodule update').

Install CoffeScript (tested with 1.0.1) and run `cake build'.
The `maikados.js' should be in your directory now.

Hints for developers (client)
=============================

- use `cake autobuild' ;-)
- use the coding style already there please
